/*
Project Euler - Problem #12: Highly divisible triangular number
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

/*
Two main optimizations made:
1. Instead of calculating the ith triangular number each time by summing from 1 -> i, we can just
use the answer from i - 1 and add i to it EDIT: no reason to use an array to store all the values since we don't use previous
values anyway
2. To find all the factors, instead of iterating from 1 -> n and doing trial division for each value,
we can iterate up to sqrt(n); for each i that evenly divides n, we check if i == n/i. If it's not, then we iterate
the factor count twice. Example: 28 % 2 = 0 and 28 / 2 = 14 which is another factor. This way, we
can find around two factors in each iteration we get a hit. (Note: not always the case to count by 2 for each hit
ex. 25 % 5 = 0 and 25 / 5 = 5 so here we would only iterate count by 1)
